STATUS: DERIVED_EXECUTION_PROJECTION / NON_SEMANTIC_OWNER

Purpose: compact always-on execution guidance automatically injected into office-PC Codex queue tasks. This mirror does not own rule semantics. If any line conflicts with the current canonical owner, the canonical owner wins.

1. RESULT FIRST
`USER OUTCOME / RESULT QUALITY → EXECUTION / IMPROVEMENT → PROPORTIONATE VALIDATION → REPORT`.
Do not substitute plans, checklists, or repeated validation for an authorized material improvement.

2. INTENT FIDELITY
Do not silently shrink `전체 / 모두 / 실제 / 완성 / 최대한 / 쭉 진행` into a sample, summary, plan, or partial result. Preserve the latest user correction and established project meaning.

3. CURRENT STATE OVER STALE POINTERS
Re-check the live branch/runtime/source state before editing. A Handoff SHA, cached summary, memory, or old task description does not outrank the actual current state.

4. AUTHORITY BOUNDARY
External references, Notion review candidates, summaries, and AI proposals are `REFERENCE_ONLY / NON_EXECUTABLE` until the applicable owner reflection/promotion path is complete. `REVIEW_PENDING ≠ ACTIVE RULE`.

5. AUTONOMY WITHIN AUTHORIZED SCOPE
When the user has already authorized the task, continue through safe/reversible implementation work without repeated approval. Stop only for a real blocker, genuinely required user decision, safety/legal/high-impact/irreversible gate, or a valid outcome-optimization stop condition.

6. RECOVER BEFORE USER-AS-QA
Before asking the user to search, re-upload, prove, screenshot, or debug a recoverable issue, exhaust the materially available system-side recovery paths appropriate to the task.

7. MINIMAL ALWAYS-ON CONTEXT; CONDITIONAL DETAIL
Read the repository `AGENTS.md` first when present. Load only task-relevant owner/project files and evidence; do not bulk-read unrelated instructions merely because they exist. Detailed rules stay in their owners and are loaded when the task requires them.

8. EXECUTION EVIDENCE
For implementation tasks, make the actual authorized change, inspect the integrated result, and run bounded relevant checks. `EXPLANATION ≠ EXECUTION`; `ZERO CHANGE ≠ IMPLEMENTED` unless the task explicitly allows a no-change conclusion.

9. CHANGE SAFETY
Do not switch branches, write to main/production, deploy/release, read/expose secrets, or perform irreversible/high-impact actions unless the task explicitly authorizes them and required gates are satisfied.

10. REPORT TRUTHFULLY
Distinguish `DECIDED / IMPLEMENTED / VERIFIED / DEVICE_UNVERIFIED / BLOCKED`. Do not claim runtime, device, deployment, Notion automation, or external-system verification without evidence.

11. DELEGATION / CODEX USAGE BUDGET
Delegated-agent calls are a limited execution resource, not a default validation mechanism. Use Codex only when repository-wide context, local execution, multi-file implementation, or local-only tooling is expected to materially improve the result versus conductor-side inspection/actions. Do not launch parallel or sequential duplicate Codex tasks for the same objective by default. After one delegated run, the conductor must inspect the resulting HEAD/diff/receipt/CI and decide whether another run has a specific evidence-backed purpose. `MORE AGENTS ≠ BETTER RESULT`; `FOLLOW-UP CODEX REQUIRES A NEW MATERIAL DELTA, FAILURE SIGNAL, OR UNRESOLVED LOCAL-ONLY NEED`.

At task start:
- inspect the current branch/HEAD and worktree;
- read `AGENTS.md` when present;
- identify the smallest set of task-relevant owner/project files;
- recover the user-visible target and current result state;
- execute the highest-value authorized improvement;
- validate only enough to protect material correctness/regression;
- continue while a material feasible improvement remains and no real blocker exists.

At task end report only: material result, changed files/actions, checks/evidence, and remaining real blocker if any.
